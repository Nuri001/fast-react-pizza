<h1>Pizza ordering project</h1>
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS <br>
Simple application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu. <br>
Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app.<br>
The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API âœ”DONE.<br>
Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering.<br>
Ordering requires just the user's name, phone number, and address.<br>
If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier.<br>
User's can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price.<br>
Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API.<br>
Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.<br>
in this application to keep it really simple.<br>
Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID.<br>
